What is INI?
-----------------------------------------

CIRRENT™ IoT Network Intelligence is a cloud software solution that helps data-driven product development to improve user experience, improve product reviews, decrease returns, and increase sales. CIRRENT™ INI uses the CIRRENT™ Agent embedded software in your IoT product to securely report data into the CIRRENT™ Cloud and provide real-time access for your product management and engineering teams via the CIRRENT™ Console. With CIRRENT™ INI, your product and engineering teams can solve customer and product problems faster. To get started, register for a free account or contact sales for more information.
