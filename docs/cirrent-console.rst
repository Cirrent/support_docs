CIRRENT™ Console
=================

The CIRRENT™ Console is the web application that you use to interact with the full range of CIRRENT™ services. You can access the CIRRENT™ Console here: https://cirrent.infineon.com.

CIRRENT™ Console Sections
--------------------------

The CIRRENT™ Console is organized into four sections. Your CIRRENT™ account status determines which CIRRENT™ Console sections you can access, depending on the CIRRENT™ products and services you subscribe to.

* **Product analytics** including sections covering the analytics and investigative tools included in CIRRENT™ Product Analytics, including CIRRENT™ INI and CIRRENT™ MAI. Sections included under the Product Analytics tab include Device Fleet, Device Inspector, App Inspector, Customer Support, Dashboard Manager and Data Exports.

* **Device management** enables you to manage the devices enrolled in the CIRRENT™ Cloud. Use this section to manage device enrollment and authentication. Under this section you can access CIRRENT™ Cloud ID and you can also view a full list of Active Devices.

* **Development** includes two developer tools – the Log Explorer and a Token Validator.

* **Accounting settings** allows you to manage API keys for the CIRRENT™ Mobile App SDK, and contains an area for user management. 

.. note:: The sections that are visible in your CIRRENT™ Console depend on the CIRRENT™ services you subscribe to, and the role your assigned to your user. 

CIRRENT™ Console User Architecture
-----------------------------------

Users
^^^^^^

In the CIRRENT™ Console a user represents an individual person in a company. Every user is defined by a unique email address. Infineon manages users and user authentication with a login at myInfineon. These credentials applies to the CIRRENT™ services, the Infineon community, and other Infineon services.

Accounts
^^^^^^^^^

An account represents a unique collection of devices. A device can only be associated with one account. Each user may be a member of multiple accounts. 
When you log into the CIRRENT™ Console, you’ll be asked to select an account to access, or you may be given the ability to create a new account. 

If you are the person creating a new account you will automatically be the administrator on the new account, and you will be able to add users to the new account as needed.

Roles
^^^^^^^^^

Each user in an account can be assigned one or more roles. The roles available to assign are:

* **Developer role:** allows users to log in to the console and see data for devices on the account

* **Operations role:** allows a user to add Device Types and Devices to an account

* **Administrator role:** includes the ability to create or delete users, create and delete API keys


Managing Users

You can add new users and modify the details of existing users in the **User Management** section. Simply navigate to **Account Settings** and **Users**.
