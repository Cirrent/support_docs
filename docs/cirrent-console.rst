Cirrent Console
=================

The CIRRENT™ Console is the web application where you interact with the CIRRENT™ services.
You can access the CIRRENT™ Console here: https://cirrent.infineon.com

The Cirent Console is organized into Users, Accounts, and Roles.

Users
------

A User represents an individual person in a company, and is defined
by a unique email address.  Infineon manages users and user authentciation
with the login at myInfineon, which applies to the Cirent services, the Infineon
community, and other Infineon services.

Accounts
---------

An Account represents a unique collection of Devices (e.g. any
Device is only associated with one Account).  Each user may be a member of multiple
Accounts.

When you log into the CIRRENT™ Console, you'll be asked to select an Account to access,
or be given the ability to create a new Account.  If you create a new Account, you will
be automatically an Admin on the new Account, and you will be able to add Users to the
new Account.

Roles
-------

Each User in an Account has one or more Roles.  The Roles available to assign are:
* **Admin**: An Admin has the ability to create or delete Users, create and delete Keys,
and all other functions in the system.
