CIRRENT™ Console for Cloud ID
==============================

The CIRRENT™ Console is the web app that you use to make use of CIRRENT™ Cloud ID services. You can read more about the CIRRENT™ Console here, including the ability to add and remove users. In this section we list some points pertinent to Cloud ID users.

User roles for Cloud ID
************************

There are two CIRRENT™ Console roles that pertain to Cloud ID users:

**Device Registrar:**  users with this role can only bind devices to their corporate account.  This role is typically used for users in a manufacturing facility or warehouse, solely to register devices for the Product Company that they represent.  


**Administrator.** An administrator can perform all the action of a device registrar. The administrator role is required to download Manifest Files, to configure APIs and to trigger device registration in API if needed. This is a back-office task that involves advanced cloud ID skills and access to cloud infrastructure.  

Switching between accounts
***************************

Where a specific user has access to more than one Cloud ID account the user can easily switch between accounts while staying logged into CIRRENT™ Cloud ID. Simply navigate to the desired account by using the drop down next to your username at the top right of the CIRRENT™ Console page.
