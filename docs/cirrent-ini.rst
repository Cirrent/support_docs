Cirrent IoT Network Intelligence (INI)
========================================

What is INI?
-----------------------------------------

Cirrent's IoT Network Intelligence (INI) is a service that makes it easy
for companies making connected products to understand their product performance in the field.

INI uses a piece of embedded code - the Cirrent Agent - to collect data from products in the field and send
it to the secure Cirrent Cloud, where the data can be analyzed using the Cirrent INI services and dashboards.

What INI can do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

INI allows you to:

* **Identify**  connectivity problems

  * Look at broad trends from your entire fleet

  * Correlate performance and issues across multiple variables (router, ISP, fw/hw version, or your own custom parameters)

* **Characterize**  impacted products and customers

  * Isolate issues by characterizing across additional environmental, user, or product variables

  * Quantify the scope of the impact

* **Identify**  which products are facing the situations and problems

  * Create groups of products with specific characteristics

* **Diagnose**  the cause of the problem

  * Run diagnostic protocols on impacted products

  * Analyze data to understand root cause

Engineers can quickly get products up and running using INI by
