------------------------------------------------

Cirrent Cloud ID is a service that extends the chain of trust
from an Infineon chip to your cloud.  Cloud-ID-compatible products

device authentication, and the Cirrent Cloud ID service facilitates a
simple manufacturing process that can be done in an insecure facility
without compromising device security.
